# Music Releases

A project where we were supposed to a responsive music-application page in react.

## The problem

We tried to split up the components as much as we could to be able to practice using props. We chose to implement some states to be able to use onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave. This was the easiest way, we could find, to accomplish the hovering effects.

If we had more time we would probably do a filter function and make different components for the albums and the singles.
